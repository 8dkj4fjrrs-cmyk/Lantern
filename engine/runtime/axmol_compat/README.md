# Axmol compatibility headers (`axmol_compat`)

Lantern builds Axmol without yasio (see
[ADR 0012](../../../docs/adr/0012-no-yasio.md)). Axmol's core still includes a
few yasio headers outside its networking code: a growable buffer, binary
streams for its settings file, clocks and string helpers. This folder
provides those headers.

- **It is Lantern's own code** (MIT), written from scratch for Lantern. It
  contains no yasio code.
- **It keeps yasio's file and type names** (`yasio/byte_buffer.hpp`,
  `yasio::byte_buffer`, `cxx20::starts_with`, ...), so Axmol's sources compile
  without being edited. Only what Axmol's core uses is provided, nothing more.
- **Behaviour Axmol relies on is kept**, and tested in
  `tests/runtime/test_axmol_compat.cpp`:
  - buffers use `malloc`/`free`, because Axmol hands their memory to code that
    calls `free()`;
  - `resize()` leaves new elements uninitialised;
  - `pod_vector<T> v{n}` means *n* elements;
  - the settings-file byte layout (big-endian numbers, 7-bit encoded string
    lengths), so settings saved by other Axmol games still load;
  - `insert_sorted` keeps equal elements in insertion order (the scheduler
    depends on it).

| Header | Used by Axmol for |
|---|---|
| `byte_buffer.hpp`, `pod_vector.hpp` | file data, images, vertices, the scheduler (`axstd::byte_buffer`, `axstd::pod_vector`) |
| `ibstream.hpp`, `obstream.hpp`, `byte_order.hpp` | `UserDefault`'s file; the Metal shader loader |
| `string_view.hpp` | path prefix checks |
| `utils.hpp` | log time stamps, timing |
| `thread_name.hpp` | naming the job system's threads |
| `ref_ptr.hpp`, `object_pool.hpp` | `SimpleTimer` |
| `sz.hpp` | an alignment macro |
| `wtimer_hres.hpp` | the 1 ms timer on Windows |

`byte_order.hpp` is the only header with a name yasio does not have.

## How it is wired in

`cmake/LanternAxmol.cmake` does three things:
1. it deletes `external/axmol/3rdparty/yasio`;
2. it sets `AX_WITH_YASIO`, `AX_ENABLE_NETWORK` and `AX_ENABLE_CONSOLE`
   off;
3. it links the `lantern_axmol_compat` interface target into Axmol's
   `3rdparty` target.

The patch that adds those two switches to Axmol is in
[`cmake/axmol-patches/`](../../../cmake/axmol-patches/README.md).

## When Axmol is updated

Build it. A compile error naming a `yasio/` header or a `yasio::`, `cxx17::`
or `cxx20::` name means Axmol's core started using something new. Add it
here, written from the standard library or from how Axmol uses it, never
copied from yasio. Then add a test for any behaviour Axmol depends on.
